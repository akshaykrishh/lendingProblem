You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan
application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
<li> If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
<li> If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
<br>
<br>
The data <i>loan.csv</i> contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
